# ⚙️ Python Operators - Complete Guide

In Python, **operators** are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. This guide covers all major types of operators with examples.

## 🧮 1. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables and perform shorthand operations.
```python
name = "Dave"
number = 42
number += 1  # Add and assign
number -= 1  # Subtract and assign
number *= 10 # Multiply and assign
number /= 10 # Divide and assign
number = round(number)
number %= 10 # Modulo and assign
```

## ➕ 2. Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations.
```python
print(2 + 2)      # Addition
print(4 - 2)      # Subtraction
print(2 * 2)      # Multiplication
print(24 / 5)     # Division (float)
print(24 // 5)    # Floor Division (int)
print(24 % 5)     # Modulo (remainder)
print(2 ** 3)     # Exponentiation
```

## 🔗 3. String Concatenation
```python
str1 = "Dave " + "Gray"
print(str1)  # Dave Gray
```
