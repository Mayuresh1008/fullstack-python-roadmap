# 🔁 Python Loops

Loops allow us to execute a block of code multiple times. Python provides two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

---

## 🔹 For Loop
Use `for` loops when you know ahead of time how many times you want to iterate.

### ✅ Basic Example
```python
name = "Abhishek"
for i in name:
    print(i, end=" ")
```
