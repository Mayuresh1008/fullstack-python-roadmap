Matchcase Statements:
match-case statements (also called as structured pattern matching) provides a powerful alternative to long if-elif-else chains.
It's similar to switch-case in other languages but more flexible.

Basic Syntax:
match value:
    case pattern1:
        # action1
    case pattern2:
        # action2
    case _: # default case
        # default action
