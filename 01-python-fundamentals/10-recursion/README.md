# 🔁 Python Recursion

Recursion is a powerful technique where a function **calls itself** to solve smaller sub-problems of a larger problem.

## 📘 What is Recursion?
A recursive function is a function that calls itself until a base condition is met.

### 🧠 Basic Syntax:
```python
def recursive_function():
    if condition_to_stop:        # Base case
        return something
    else:
        return recursive_function()  # Recursive call
```
