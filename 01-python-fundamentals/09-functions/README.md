## ğŸ”„ Using Functions

### ğŸ”¸ Example: Calculating Geometric Mean
```python
def calculateGmean(a, b):
    mean = (a * b) / (a + b)
    print(mean)

calculateGmean(9, 8)
```

### ğŸ”¸ Example: Checking Greater Number
```python
def isGreater(a, b):
    if a > b:
        print("First number is greater")
    else:
        print("Second number is greater or both are equal")

isGreater(9, 7)
```
